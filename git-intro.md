## What is Git?
``Git`` is a ``distributed version control`` software. Version control is a way to save changes over time without overwriting previous versions. Being ``distributed`` means that every developer working with a Git repository has a copy of that entire repository – every commit, every branch, every file.

Whether or not you've worked with version control before, there are a few things you should know before getting started with Git:

## Why use Git?
Version control is very important – without it, you risk losing your work. With Git, you can make a "commit", or a save point, as often as you'd like. You can also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure off of you while you're working. Commit often and commit early, and you'll never have that gut-sinking feeling of overwriting or losing changes.

There are many version control systems out there – but Git has some major advantages.
+ Git uses SHA compression, which makes it very fast. Git stores changes in SHA hashes, which work by compressing text files. That makes Git a very good version control system (VCS) for software programming, but not so good for binary files like images or videos.
+ Storage inefficiency - Binary files, such as images and videos, are typically already compressed in specific formats (JPEG, PNG, MP4, etc.). Git's delta compression works by storing the differences (or deltas) between versions of files. However, changes to binary files often result in significant alterations across the entire file, rather than just localized changes. As a result, Git may need to store multiple complete copies of the file, especially if changes are frequent or substantial. This can lead to increased storage requirements compared to text files, where changes are typically localized to specific lines.
+ Binary files may undergo significant changes with each version, making it harder for Git to efficiently manage and store these changes. This can result in slower performance and larger repository sizes over time. Git stores the entire history of files in its repository, which includes all versions of each file. For large binary files like videos, this can quickly lead to a bloated repository size. Git was originally designed to handle text-based source code files where changes are frequent but typically small in size. Managing large binary files with Git can therefore be cumbersome and inefficient.
+ Operations such as cloning a Git repository or checking out different versions involve transferring and potentially processing all files in the repository. With large binary files, these operations can be slower and require more network bandwidth and processing power compared to repositories containing primarily text files. Git relies on textual differences to track changes efficiently. For text files, Git can easily display line-by-line changes and compute differences. However, binary files lack this line-by-line structure, making it difficult for Git to provide meaningful diffs or efficiently compute changes between versions.

Branches are lightweight and cheap, so it's OK to have many of them. Git stores changes in SHA hashes, which work by compressing text files. That makes Git a very good version control system (VCS) for software programming, but not so good for binary files like images or videos.
Git repositories can be connected, so you can work on one locally on your own machine, and connect it to a shared repository. This way, you can push and pull changes to a repository and easily collaborate with others.
